:nut_and_bolt: What is the "kitchen sink"?
==========================================

This directory is only slightly adapted from the directory
of the same name in the [pradyunsg/furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo)
repository. It is replicated here as an easy way to test the features
of this combination of documentation software (Sphinx + Furo + Furiosa).
The original license is copied in this directory for your reference.
